Treasure Maze navigation with Q-learning algorithm

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 

What code were you given? 
  We were provided with 2 Python files and a Jupyter notebook. The Python functions were already constructed
and the Jupyter notebook was already mostly set up. Our assignment was to complete the window marked "TODO:". 


What code did you create yourself?
  I created the algorithm in the "TODO:" section that implemented an epsilon value and a rate of decay value.
This code is designed to give the agent a balanced model that considerably promotes exploration early on and 
slowly relies more and more on exploitations.


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists are professionals who use their knowledge and skills in computer science to solve problems, 
create solutions, and advance the capabilities of computers and technology.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  I could approach any problem as a computer scientist by gathering data, considering multiple angles of the problem,
designing a solution, testing that solution, implementing that solution, and then reflecting upon and learning from
that process.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  As computer scientists, we have ethical responsibilities to both the end user and the organization we work for to 
respect their rights, interests, and values, while ensuring quality, security, and privacy.
